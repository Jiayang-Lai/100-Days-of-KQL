# Official Document

[sort operator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/sort-operator?view=microsoft-fabric)

# Note

This operator comes handy when trying to return the most recently records in Sentinel query as the query tab in Sentinel limits the total return count, and the first record can be random without specifying order. Also, sort accepts multiple columns as comparison column.
